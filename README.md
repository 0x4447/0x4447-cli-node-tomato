# DG Express Generator

Over the years I think I found out a nice default template that I can use to start a new ExpressJS project.

# Key Features

- My personal commenting style that I like and allows me to better understand the code.
- Simplified and explained the `server` file in the `bin` folder
- By default I use clustering
- By default I force HTTPS when code is deployed
- Redesigned how errors are handled
- By default I use Hogan
- Favicon done right. Make your own five icon using [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net)
- Basic Open Graph support
- End everything is organized how I like it :)

# Installation

```
$ npm install express-generator-dg -g
```

# How to use

Once you have this npm package installed globally, you can use it anywhere. Go to a folder where you would like to create a new project and:

```
$ express-generator-dg NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER
```

Then you'll have to go in to the directory you just created and type:

```
$ npm install
```

Then you'll need to create a `.env` file to load your environment variables in to memory thanks to `foreman`, or you can also just install [env-auto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-auto) and then type:

```
$ env-auto
```

To get the `.env` file automatically created from the `app.json` file. Last thing would be to start the whole thing with:

```
$ npm start
```

# WARNING

This tool will override, destroy, kill and crash everything in its path - you've been warned ;)

# Fork It

This project was designed to allow you to make it your own - thanks to it simplicity. Once forked you just have to change the content of the `source` folder, and you have your own easy to use template up and running when you need it.
