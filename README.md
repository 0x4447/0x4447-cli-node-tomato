# DG Express Generator

Over the years I think I found out a nice default template that I can use to start new ExpressJS project.

# Key Features

- My personal commenting style that I like and allows me to better understand the code.
- Simplified the `server` file in the `bin` folder
- By default I use clustering
- By default I force HTTPS when in production
- Redesigned how I handle Errors
- By default I use Hogan
- End everything is organized how I like it :)

# Installation

```
$ npm install express-generator-dg -g
```

# How to use

Once you have this npm package installed globally, you can use it anywhere. Go to a folder where you would like to create a new project and:

```
$ express-generator-dg NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER
```

# WARNING

This tool will override, destroy, kill and crash everything in its path - you've been warned ;)
