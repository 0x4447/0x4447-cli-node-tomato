# DG Express Generator

I decided to make my own [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) because I always spend quite some time brining the default ExpressJS template up to speed, by changing things that I didn't like etc. After making `express-generator-dg` for myself I decided to share it with the world.

But if you don't like what you see, you can easily clone this repo, and by changing the content of the `source` folder, you'll have your own `express-generator`.

# Key Features

- My personal commenting style that I like
- Simplified and explained the `server` file so from the start you know what each line dose
- By default I use clustering
- By default I use compression when sending requests
- By default I force HTTPS in production - no excuses
- Redesigned how errors are handled and displayed
- By default I use Hogan for the templating - nice and simple
- Favicon done right. Make your own five icon using [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net)
- Basic Open Graph support
- Twitter Cards support
- Sentry Support by default set it to report crashes only in production
- By default I use Knex to talk with the database
- Code that starts the server is in `workers` folder since it is a worker, and since I always end up with more the the server I have everything in place
- End everything is organized how I like it :)

# The whole flow to have the project up and running is this:

```
$ npm install express-generator-dg -g
```

Once you have this npm package installed globally, you can use it anywhere. Go to a folder where you want to create a new project and:

```
$ express-generator-dg NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER
```

Then you'll have to go in to the directory you just created and type:

```
$ npm install
```

Then you'll need to create a `.env` file to load your environment variables in to memory thanks to `foreman`, or you can also just install another tool that I made called [env-auto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-auto) like so:

```
$ npm install env-auto -g
```

and then in the root folder of your project type:

```
$ env-auto
```

to get the `.env` file automatically created from the `app.json` file. Last thing would be to start the whole thing with:

```
$ npm start
```

# WARNING

This tool will override, destroy, kill and crash everything in its path - you've been warned ;)

# Fork It

This project was designed to allow you to make it your own - thanks to it simplicity. Once forked you just have to change the content of the `source` folder, and you have your own easy to use template up and running when you need it.
